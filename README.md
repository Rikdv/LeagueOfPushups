# League of Pushups

League of pushups is an android app that lets the user perform an amount of pushups based on the player's performance. 

  - The app notes the player's kills, deaths and assists in a game.
  - The app checks the player's champion mastery and either increases or decreases the amount. The higher the champion mastery, the more punishing the app will be.
 
The app also shows the damage dealt to champions and damage taken graphs. These graphs might give the player an idea of how he or she performed.
